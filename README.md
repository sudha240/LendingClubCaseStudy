## General Information
Based on the applicant’s profile company will decide to approve the loan application or not.
The aim of this case study is to identify the risky loan applicants, so that loans sanctioned to these applicants can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such risky applicants will be done using Exploratory Data Analysis.
### There are two types of risks associated with the bank’s decision:
1. Loss of business to company if applicant is likely to repay loan and is not sanctioned the loan approval.
2. Approving the loan to an applicant who is not likely to repay loan may bring financial loss for the company.
### Two types of decisions taken by the company:
1. Loan accepted: 
If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:
• Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)
• Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e., the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted’.
• Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e., he/she has defaulted on the loan.
2. Loan rejected: 
If company did not approve the loan because of not meeting the requirements of the bank rules.

## Conclusions
1. It is safe to provide loans to employees with higher income, low DTI value for 36 months tenure.
2. It is also safe to provide loans to applicants whose home is mortgaged, and purpose of the loan is debt consolidation.
